My social media platform leverages Azure to provide a scalable and engaging user experience. Users interact with the app via web or mobile, with data stored in Azure Cosmos DB for flexibility and performance. To speed up responses, frequently accessed data is cached in Azure Cache for Redis. Azure App Service hosts the backend API and frontend as well as Kubernetes engine with containers, while Azure Functions handle background tasks. We use Azure Blob Storage for user-generated content and Azure CDN for fast content delivery. This architecture ensures high availability, scalability, and a seamless user experience.
